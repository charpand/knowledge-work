# Draft Advisory Response to Policy or Proposal

## Name
Draft Advisory Response to Policy or Proposal

## Purpose
Provides structured guidance to stakeholders on a proposed policy, regulation, or organizational decision. Used when an organization seeks analytical perspective on potential impacts, risks, and implementation considerations before committing resources.

## Inputs

### Required
- Policy or proposal document (text, PDF, or structured summary)
- Stakeholder context (who requested the advisory, their decision timeline, constraints)
- Scope of analysis (specific aspects to prioritize or exclude)

### Optional
- Prior related decisions or policies for consistency checking
- Historical outcomes from similar proposals
- Budget or resource constraints

## Referenced Skills
- Define and Enforce a Quality Bar
- Terraform Design Review

## Process Constraints
- Response must maintain neutral analytical tone, free of advocacy or preference
- Must identify assumptions explicitly when information is incomplete
- Must distinguish between risks, gaps in proposal, and implementation challenges
- Must not propose solutions beyond the scope of advisory (advisory identifies issues; implementation belongs elsewhere)

## Output Contract

The advisory response must contain:

1. **Executive Summary** (1-2 paragraphs): Core findings and highest-priority concerns
2. **Scope and Limitations**: What was analyzed and what was out of scope
3. **Risk Assessment**: Categorized by severity and likelihood (critical/high/medium/low)
4. **Gaps and Ambiguities**: Missing information or contradictions in the proposal
5. **Cross-domain Impacts**: How the proposal affects related systems, processes, or stakeholders
6. **Assumptions**: Explicit list of unstated assumptions made during analysis
7. **Next Steps**: Recommended analysis, validation, or stakeholder consultation needed before decision

Format: Markdown document, approximately 2,000-3,000 words.

## Quality Checks

Before delivery, validate:
- [ ] Neutral tone maintained throughout; no advocacy present
- [ ] All claims are traceable to proposal content or cited external reference
- [ ] Risks are categorized by severity and clearly distinguish between likelihood and impact
- [ ] Assumptions are explicitly stated, not hidden in prose
- [ ] Response avoids prescriptive language ("must do X") unless explicitly requested as part of scope
- [ ] Stakeholder context is reflected (e.g., timeline constraints, prior commitments addressed)
