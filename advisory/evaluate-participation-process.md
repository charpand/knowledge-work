# Evaluate Participation Process Quality

## Name
Evaluate Participation Process Quality

## Purpose
Assesses whether a participation process (stakeholder consultation, community input, feedback cycle, or multi-party decision-making) is genuine and effective, or whether it is performative. Applied to validate that participation mechanisms actually shape outcomes rather than serving as compliance theater.

## Inputs

### Required
- Description of the participation process (how input was collected, who participated, timeline)
- Input that was collected (stakeholder feedback, proposals, concerns)
- Outcome or decision that resulted from the process
- Mechanism for how input was supposed to influence the outcome

### Optional
- Prior participation processes in same organization for pattern comparison
- Documented decision-making criteria or framework
- Stakeholder expectations or stated purpose of participation

## Referenced Skills
- Detect and Avoid Checkbox Participation
- Define and Enforce a Quality Bar

## Process Constraints
- Must assess process design, not the quality of individual contributions
- Must evaluate whether participation mechanisms are designed to influence decisions, not whether they did
- Must not assume bad faith; focus on structural incentives and information flow
- Must identify where the process creates illusion of influence without structural mechanism to implement feedback
- Must distinguish between reasons feedback was not implemented (valid technical constraints vs. pre-decided outcomes)

## Output Contract

The evaluation must contain:

1. **Process Summary**: How participation was solicited, timeframe, participants
2. **Feedback Received**: Categorization of input by theme, volume, and consistency
3. **Mapping to Outcome**: How (or whether) stakeholder input was connected to the final decision
4. **Structural Assessment**:
   - Was feedback collected before or after decision?
   - Was there mechanism to modify outcome based on feedback?
   - Were conflicts or contradictions in feedback addressed explicitly?
5. **Genuine vs. Checkbox**: Specific evidence for whether participation was structural or performative
6. **Risk Assessment**: Likelihood that stakeholders feel unheard or manipulated
7. **Improvement Recommendations**: If process was checkbox-based, specific structural changes to make it genuine

Format: Structured assessment, 1,200-2,000 words.

## Quality Checks

Before delivery, validate:
- [ ] Assessment is based on process design, not judgment of participants
- [ ] Connection between input and outcome is explicitly mapped (not inferred)
- [ ] Genuine vs. checkbox assessment cites specific structural evidence
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable for next participation cycle
- [ ] Risk assessment distinguishes between intent and structural outcome
- [ ] No assumption of bad faith without evidence
