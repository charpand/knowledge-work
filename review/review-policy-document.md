# Review Policy Document for Risks, Gaps, and Assumptions

## Name
Review Policy Document for Risks, Gaps, and Assumptions

## Purpose
Conducts systematic analysis of policy documents to surface unintended consequences, logical contradictions, and unstated assumptions. Applied before policy adoption or rollout to reduce implementation friction and identify areas requiring clarification or additional controls.

## Inputs

### Required
- Policy document (full text or structured outline)
- Context on policy scope (who it affects, intended outcomes, timeline)
- Current state baseline (existing related policies, organizational constraints)

### Optional
- Historical precedent (how similar policies performed)
- Stakeholder feedback or concerns to prioritize
- Implementation environment constraints

## Referenced Skills
- Define and Enforce a Quality Bar
- Detect and Avoid Checkbox Participation

## Process Constraints
- Review must identify gaps and risks systematically, not superficially
- Must separate intentional policy design choices from unintended oversights
- Must not recommend policy reversal or major restructuring; focus on gaps and risks only
- Must explicitly distinguish between logical gaps and implementation concerns
- Must validate that stated policy goals are actually achievable through the mechanisms proposed

## Output Contract

The review must contain:

1. **Policy Summary**: Restatement of core intent and mechanisms (confirms mutual understanding)
2. **Scope and Affected Parties**: Clear definition of who the policy binds and how
3. **Risk Register**: Each identified risk stated as "If [condition], then [consequence]"
   - Categorize by severity: critical (mission failure), high (operational impact), medium (process friction), low (edge case)
   - Include probability assessment
4. **Logical Gaps**: Contradictions, ambiguities, or missing prerequisites
5. **Unstated Assumptions**: Implicit conditions required for policy success (e.g., "assumes sufficient staffing", "assumes X budget available")
6. **Verification Checkpoints**: What must be true at implementation time for policy to be viable
7. **Recommended Clarifications**: Specific wording changes or additions to close gaps

Format: Structured document with clear sections and risk table, 1,500-2,500 words.

## Quality Checks

Before delivery, validate:
- [ ] All identified gaps are traceable to specific policy language or logical flow
- [ ] Risks follow explicit if-then logic, not speculation
- [ ] Assumptions are stated neutrally (not as criticisms)
- [ ] No recommendation goes beyond identifying gaps or risks
- [ ] Scope definition prevents misinterpretation of policy boundaries
- [ ] Verification checkpoints are operationally testable, not aspirational
