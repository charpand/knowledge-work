# Summarize Meeting into Decisions and Action Points

## Name
Summarize Meeting into Decisions and Action Points

## Purpose
Transforms raw meeting notes or recordings into a structured record of decisions made, commitments accepted, and follow-up work required. Provides clarity on what was decided versus what was discussed, clarifying accountability and preventing post-meeting confusion or scope creep.

## Inputs

### Required
- Meeting notes (transcript, recording transcript, or written notes)
- Meeting context (participants, stated objectives, date)
- Stakeholder who will receive the summary

### Optional
- Prior decisions or commitments referenced during meeting
- Decision-making framework or approval authority used
- Known constraints or precedent

## Referenced Skills
- Define and Enforce a Quality Bar

## Process Constraints
- Must distinguish between decisions (commitments to act or change) and discussions (exploration without commitment)
- Must assign explicit ownership to each action (person/team, not "someone")
- Must not interpret or infer decisions not explicitly stated; flag ambiguities
- Must use participant language when possible to avoid misrepresentation
- Timeline must be specified for each action (date, quarter, or event-based)

## Output Contract

The summary must contain:

1. **Meeting Header**: Date, participants, stated objectives
2. **Decisions Made** (prioritized by urgency/impact):
   - Decision statement (clear, outcome-focused)
   - Rationale briefly summarized
   - Approval authority if applicable
3. **Commitments and Action Items**:
   - Owner (person/team name, not generic)
   - Action description (verb + outcome)
   - Due date or trigger
   - Dependencies or prerequisites
4. **Open Questions**: Issues raised but not resolved (with assigned owner for follow-up if applicable)
5. **Risks or Concerns Raised**: Issues identified but not yet addressed by decision
6. **Next Scheduled Touchpoint**: When this work will be reviewed or next decision point

Format: Email-ready or shared document format, concise (under 1,000 words).

## Quality Checks

Before delivery, validate:
- [ ] Each decision is stated as a commitment, not a suggestion
- [ ] Action items have named owners, not generic assignees
- [ ] All timelines are specific (not "soon" or "ASAP")
- [ ] No inferred decisions; ambiguities flagged explicitly
- [ ] Open questions include assigned owner for resolution
- [ ] Summary can be read independently without access to original notes
- [ ] Participant language is accurate; technical terms verified
